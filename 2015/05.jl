# --- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? --- Santa needs help
# figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

# A nice string is one with all of the following properties:

# It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or
# aeiouaeiouaeiou.

# It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row,
# like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).

# It does not contain
# the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other
# requirements.  For example:

# ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...),
# a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.

# aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even
# though the letters used by different rules overlap.

# jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.

# haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.

# dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

# How many strings are nice?
